Name: GCam Photos Preview
Summary: Preview photos from Google Camera
Description: |-
    If you have Google Photos installed, you can safely ignore this application.

    GCam Photos Preview lets you preview photos taken in Google Camera without
    needing to install the proprietary Google Photos application.

    It pretends to be Google Photos to do that.
