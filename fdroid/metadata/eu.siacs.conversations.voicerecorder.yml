AutoName: Voice Recorder Plugin
Description: |-
    Note: As of Conversations 2.2.0 this functionality is integrated in the main app

    This simple voice recorder can be used to send voice messages from within
    Conversations, an XMPP client. It is more straightforward than using Android's
    built-in or the vendor's voice recording UIs.
