Scrambled Exif (pronounced <i>egg</i>sif) helps you remove the metadata in your pictures before you share them.

If you feel like it.

If you don't want the big Internet companies (or whomever) to know where your pictures were taken don't forget to remove the metadata from them before you share them.

To remove the metadata from a picture, simply share it like you'd normally do and choose <i>Scrambled Exif</i>. A moment later, the share 'dialog' will reappear. Now just share with the app you intended to share with in the first place.

Et voilà!

<b>Misc Stuff and Facts</b>

★ Basically, Exif is used by jpeg, which is the format in which your Android camera saves pictures. If you want to know more about Exif, check the Wikipedia.

★ Scrambled Exif also renames the files (this can be disabled).

★ Please don't heavily rely on the data being deleted. Scrambled Exif does its job pretty well, but it could fail. Always double-check before you share.

★ It doesn't really <i>scramble</i> the Exif data, it deletes it. So the name is probably stupid. But I like it. The icon doesn't depict scrambled eggs either. So the icon is probably stupid. But I like it. And I also happen to be a huge fan of eggs. So this app doesn't only have a stupid name and an equally stupid icon, it is also my (non-stupid) tribute to eggs. Especially <i>huevos fritos</i>. Because I love them.

★ Have fun sharing your pics!
