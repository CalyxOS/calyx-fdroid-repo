Description: |-
    Seamless Update Client is the System Update Client used in CalyxOS
    This update is needed to workaround an issue with the April 2020 update
    of CalyxOS. Simply install this update and launch the update client
    either by going to Settings -> System -> System update settings, or
    via the launcher (named Updater, with a matching icon), and it
    will download and install the update.
