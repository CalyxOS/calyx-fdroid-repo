Description: |-
    Aurora Services allow you to install updates in the background
    without having to confirm. This is the CalyxOS version of Aurora
    Services.

    Note: This is known to not work with Aurora Store 4.0.6, however
    it will work fine with Aurora Store 4.0.5 and 4.0.7, which
    should be available on F-Droid shortly.

    You will still need to confirm app installs and uninstalls,
    only updates are allowed without confirmation in this version.
